## A BLE codelock component for esp32
This component implements the behaviour of a BLE codelock.
It currently works but has some behaviour that is mixed with the codelock component and many functions that need to be cleaned.

### TODO
- Clean the thing
- Factor behaviours with codelock component if possible
